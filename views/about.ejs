  <h1 class="headline">Our Story</h1><br>
  <p class="subline-text">This organization was created to influence students in the City of Inglewood as well as students from neighboring cities to have an active interest in pursuing STEM fields. Many of us are aware of the shortage of diversity in STEM professions, but what is more pressing is the lack of exposure and lack of access these students have to various STEM topics at an early age. <br><br>

  For that purpose, Great Minds STEM Society was founded to provide students with hands-on STEM experience. We simply don't believe in teaching science out of a book, we believe in doing real science the kind that uses actual chemistry labs to synthesize organic compounds, study molecules, and replicate DNA. We believe in utlizing computer labs to develop websites, code robots, and creating mobile apps. We believe math should be fun and engaging while progressing with time. Such an education should be provided to everyone regardless of his or her economic standing or educational background. All students deserve the opportunity to experience the exciting and inspiring aspects of a STEM education. <br><br>

  Our programs and services will encourage academic achievement in our boys and girls by instilling a sense of competence, influence, and ownership. Great Minds STEM Society will not only be a place for learning and growth, but a place students can come in with their curious minds to have fun in discovering the strengths and limitations of each STEM field, absorbing these phenomena as a multifaceted and intricate whole. It will be a place where scientific futures are planted in the minds of our youth every single day.
